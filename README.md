## Usage

Welcomer.js is simple to use and does not require a lot of markup:

```javascript
import Welcomer from 'welcomer';
Welcomer.init();
let welcomer = new Welcomer;
```

```sass
@import "welcomer/src/welcomer"
```

```html
<div class="welcomer">
    <p class="welcomer--mobile">Window < 750px</p>
    <p>Say hello to Welcomer.js</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/jonhue/welcomer.js" target="_blank" class="welcomer--mobile">Learn more</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/jonhue/welcomer.js" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a>
    <div class="welcomer--close">
        <svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 16 16" enable-background="new 0 0 16 16" xml:space="preserve"><g transform="translate(0, 0)"><polygon fill="#fff" points="10.1,4.5 8,6.6 5.9,4.5 4.5,5.9 6.6,8 4.5,10.1 5.9,11.5 8,9.4 10.1,11.5 11.5,10.1 9.4,8 11.5,5.9 "></polygon></g></svg>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Note:** You can omit the `.welcomer--close` div, if you don't want your welcomer to be closeable manually. Elements with the `welcomer--mobile` class are also optional.

### Functions

```javascript
// Shows welcomer
welcomer.appear();

// Hides welcomer
welcomer.disappear();

// Hides welcomer in 5 seconds unless it is hovered
welcomer.autoclose(5000);
```

### Options

You can pass an options hash when constructing new objects from the `Welcomer` class:

* `autoclose` Milliseconds after which the welcomer automatically disappears. Accepts an integer or `false`. Defaults to `false`.
* `delay` Milliseconds after which welcomer opens. Accepts an integer. Defaults to `1000`.

### Styles

You can find the project's [`sass` file](src/welcomer.sass) under the root directory. If you want to modify it to integrate Welcomer.js better into your site, feel free to download and edit it. Then embed the edited version on your site.

You can change the mobile breakpoint by setting the `$welcomer--mobile` variable before importing Welcomer.js.
